      "summary": "The text outlines an end-to-end roadmap for the Trestadcenter Kyla Dashboard project, which includes the following key points:\n\n1. Discovery & Scoping:\n   - Develop product requirements for various tiles (e.g., Weather, Pumps, Contacts, Alarms)\n   - Define user roles and permissions\n   - Identify data owners and update frequencies\n\n2. System Architecture:\n   - Use MQTT for device/field bus communication and a time-series database (TimescaleDB or InfluxDB) for data storage\n   - Implement an API layer with FastAPI (Python) or NestJS (TypeScript)\n   - Use WebSocket or MQTT over WebSocket for real-time data push\n   - Build the frontend with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material-UI (or Flutter)\n   - Integrate authentication with OAuth2/JWT (Keycloak or Auth0)\n   - Set up CI/CD and operations using GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes/ECS, Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus\n\n3. UX/UI Design:\n   - Create low-fidelity Figma wireframes\n   - Develop a component library (MetricCard, StatusGrid, LogoUpload, AlarmToast)\n   - Store design tokens in a theme.ts file\n\n4. Data Contracts & Schemas:\n   - Publish JSON schemas for MQTT payloads and REST endpoints\n   - Provide examples for pump state and weather data\n\n5. Sprint Plan (2-week sprints):\n   - Set up the development environment and deploy a \"Hello World\" application\n   - Implement the static layout, weather tile, logo upload, primary pumps tile, contact/alarm tile, and mini tiles\n   - Polish the application and add offline support\n   - Implement security, metrics, and documentation\n\n6. Guardrails Against \"Hallucination\":\n   - Use TypeScript strict mode and Storybook snapshots\n   - Implement contract tests (Pact) for API payloads\n   - Render a global error boundary component\n   - Validate inbound messages using Zod or Pydantic\n\n7. DevOps Seatbelts:\n   - Implement feature flags (LaunchDarkly or Unleash)\n   - Adopt blue/green deployments with automatic smoke tests\n   - Set up an uptime monitor to send Slack alerts on 404 errors\n\n8. Security & Compliance:\n   - Ensure TLS encryption everywhere\n   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in MQTT\n   - Ensure GDPR compliance\n\n9. Documentation & Handoff:\n   - Generate OpenAPI documentation\n   - Create a living runbook for adding new metric tiles\n   - Provide architecture diagrams (C4 level 1-2)"
